                    <h2>if i had three lives</h2>
                    <p>If I had three lives, I'd marry you in two. The other? Perhaps that life over there at Starbucks, sitting alone, writing a memoir, maybe a novel or this poem. No kids probably, a small apartment with a view of the river, and books. Lots of books and time to read. Friends to laugh with, and a man sometimes, for a weekend, to remember what skin feels like when it's alive. I'd be thinner in that life, exercise a lot. I'd go to art films, farmers markets, pasar seni, art galleries and travel. I'd walk the beach at sunrise, find perfect shell spirals and study pockmarks water makes in sand. And I'd wonder sometimes if I'd ever find you.</p>
